# ESS accessibility

This is the repository for our paper titled *Integration of e-scooter sharing with public transit on employment accessibility and equity*, which is currently under review in *Transportation Research Part D*.



Due to the substantial volume of intermediate files and the complexity of organization, we have initially uploaded the essential notebooks. Additional necessary datasets (where possible) will be uploaded progressively in subsequent updates. Also, we will create more detailed instructions in the future. Thanks for your understanding.
